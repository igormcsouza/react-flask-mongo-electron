# Building a simple FullStack App

I will be starting to build a simple app with lots of useful pieces and bits for
a FullStack development. I am going to use react+typescript on the frontend and 
flask on the backend. They will communicate with each other through containers 
using docker compose to manage them! I will also use Mongo for our database!

I am also planning to use github actions for CI/CD pipeline and the google cloud 
to host this application! I am SO excited for it!!
